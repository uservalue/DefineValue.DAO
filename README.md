Quick Summary

This DAO is setup for everyone to gather & collaborate and pool together a very small initial amount of funding an see what $10 is capable of doing within a few months. I am looking for other like minded developers, gamers, enthusiasts, investors & crypto nerds to join and start utilize resources such as hosting validator nodes, utilizing your GPU with others to effectively solo mine a popular proof of work coin. An be apart of the projects rather then be a blind investor in one Deciding which coin we will start our own Node. Your initial risk investment is only $10 USD. Maximum Occupancy for this DAO is 1,000 members only requirement is a single graphics card capable of mining Ethereum. The other risk you will have in the very beginning is me running off with a few Ethereum that may of potential been solo mined. So $10 and a little electricity that you aren’t required to run 24/7 to be in this group. Priority is to push this into a smart contract if this takes off. However I would rather see a really sweet crypto dividend payout monthly then make a quick fast dollar like this. If I wanted to do fast money I’d fork a DEFI Exchange and run a few scripts to build a telegram group up. Excuse my English & grammar I know its horrible.

So why 10 USDT? EZMATH
You are purchasing the dividend payout token with this 10 USDT is  0.1% Maximum is 100 USDT or 1% of the pooled liquidity.
It does not seem like very much which is why the second requirement to join is owning a GPU. While it won’t be a requirement it will be highly recommended to utilize it to help us pool together a larger fund with minimal initial investment.

The idea behind this token is simple you can only own a max of 10 tokens the cost is $10 USDT per token. 1000 Tokens are minted 70 tokens belong to the Founders of the DAO. This gives you access to the weekly payouts on our community driven solo GPU mining pool. When ETH goes into full Proof-of-Stake the goal is to collect enough ETH within the DAO to open our own Validator node and distribute another portion of the ETH throughout the group.

The DAO is run off a popular dapp client and I love building projects but i'm at a point now where I'm just not happy seeing the route crypto is taking anymore. I picked bitcoin up in 2010 through a forums as a alternative and anonymous payment option with 0 chargeback risk as a merchant for popular MMO game services. I fell in love with the idea of a decentralized form of currency and anonimity.

 What i've seen this bull-run is a yet another large new following of uneducated people throwing their stimulus money at this stuff hoping to be like that guy who turned 1ETH into 50ETH on a token launch. Some of the tactics being used on you guys is making a select few millionaires overnight. While the currency you handed over is making a fraction. So lets see if I can successfully accomplish this goal in mind. 

Rather then hand over your Proof-of-stake coins such as ADA, Tezos, BNB, ETH, TRX & others to centralized or "decentralized" companies like coinbase, exodus, nexo, blockfi etc for them to give you an APR / APY on this token that they're ultimately deciding. You guys are taking a decentralized currency and handing it away for these companies to make millions off of you without any risk or initial investment other then operating the nodes. I don't think many realize where these rates are actually coming from and how badly you're being scalped.
